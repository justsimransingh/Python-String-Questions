# Python-String-Questions
1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars
from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the
empty string.
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String
4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all
occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'
5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings,
separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz'
6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should
be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If
the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'
7. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of
words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).
Sample Words : red, white, black, red, green, black
Expected Result : black, green, red, white
8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the
longest one
9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty
string.
10. Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the
first and last chars have been exchanged.
11. Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index
values of a given string
12. Write a Python function to create the HTML string with tags around the
word(s).
add_tags('i', 'Python') -> '<i>Python</i>'
add_tags('b', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<b>Python Tutorial </b>'
13. Write a Python function to insert a string in the middle of a string.
Sample function and result :
insert_sting_middle('[[]]<<>>', 'Python') -> [[Python]]
insert_sting_middle('{{}}', 'PHP') -> {{PHP}}
14. Write a Python program to print the following floating numbers upto 2
decimal places.
15. Write a Python program to count repeated characters in a string. Go to the
editor
Sample string: 'thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog'
Expected output :
o 4
e 3
u 2
h 2
r 2
t 2
16. Write a Python program to print the square and cube symbol in the area of a
rectangle and volume of a cylinder
The area of the rectangle is 1256.66cm2
The volume of the cylinder is 1254.725cm3
